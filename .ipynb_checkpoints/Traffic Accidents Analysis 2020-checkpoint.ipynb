    "# Analysis of Road Accidents in India 2021\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Despite efforts to improve road safety, India continues to experience a high number of road accidents, leading to significant loss of life, injuries, and economic costs. Effective solutions are needed to address these root causes and foster a culture of road safety nationwide.\n",
    "### About Project\n",
    "This project aims to analyze the relationship between various traffic violations and the occurrence of road accidents on Indian National Highways in the year 2021. By examining the dataset encompassing different states/UTs and their corresponding accident counts and fatalities related to specific traffic violations such as over-speeding, drunken driving, driving on the wrong side, jumping red lights, use of mobile phones, and other miscellaneous violations, the project seeks to identify patterns and correlations.\n",
    "### Data Sources\n",
    "- The data is sourced from official website of Government of India https://data.gov.in/\n",
    "### About dataset\n",
    "This dataset focuses on road accidents that occured in India during the year 2021. It contains information on various traffic violations and their correlation with accident occurrences and fatalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key components of dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- States/UTs: This column likely identifies the different Indian states and union territories included in the data.\n",
    "- Accident Categories: Multiple columns prefixed with \"Over-Speeding,\" \"Drunken Driving,\" etc. represent specific traffic violations. Each violation is further divided into sub-columns for:\n",
    "> Total Accidents: The total number of accidents associated with that violation on National Highways under different departments (NHAI, State PWD, Other).\n",
    "> Death: The number of fatalities resulting from accidents related to that violation under each department.\n",
    "- Total Accident and Death Counts: Separate columns exist for total accidents and deaths on National Highways under each department (NHAI, State PWD, Other) and overall totals\n",
