    "# Title\n",
    "This project aims to analyze the relationship between various traffic violations and the occurrence of road accidents on Indian National Highways in the year 2021. By examining the dataset encompassing different states/UTs and their corresponding accident counts and fatalities related to specific traffic violations such as over-speeding, drunken driving, driving on the wrong side, jumping red lights, use of mobile phones, and other miscellaneous violations, the project seeks to identify patterns and correlations.  \n",
